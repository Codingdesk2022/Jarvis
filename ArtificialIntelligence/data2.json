    ],
    "What is the theory of relativity?": [
        "The theory of relativity, Sir, consists of two main principles developed by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity explains how space and time are intertwined and how they are relative to the motion of observers. One of its most famous results is that the speed of light is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion, and that time can appear to pass at different rates depending on one's velocity.",
        "General relativity, Sir, extends this by describing how mass and energy influence the curvature of spacetime, effectively explaining the force of gravity as the bending of spacetime around massive objects. This theory has been confirmed through numerous experiments and is essential to the understanding of everything from GPS systems to the behavior of stars and black holes."
